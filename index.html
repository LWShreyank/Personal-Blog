  Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.

      It is a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Hiring a tour guide will be better to understand the stories of such a historical place. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It is a historical site and famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago

        Out of all the movies that had ever come out of Disney, "The Lion King" is what I consider to be their greatest achievement of all time. Right as the opening sequence commenced with the "Circle of Life", my heart was so pumped, down to the point where I felt like a kid again every time I saw it. The story was epic on giving an insight of the steps in becoming the next-in-line, the challenges on losing someone dear to them and overcoming their fears, and fighting for what's rightfully theirs. Not only that, but its breathtaking animation really grabs the viewers' experience by showcasing the vast landscapes surrounding Pride Rock as well as all the natural wildlife that settles within. When it comes to the characters, they all had their unique chemistry towards each other and it was really touching to have a father-son relationship spreading throughout most of the movie, which would come in handy for the main character to discover who he really is. While all of this definitely had their moments, the main reason why I consider this as the absolute best to come from Disney would have to be its powerful and emotional score. There were so many colorful and thrilling hits to name, from the dark and mysterious "Be Prepared", "I Just Can't Wait to be King", to the heartfelt and genuine "Can You Feel The Love Tonight", along with the popular "Hakuna Matata". I just can't think of any other Disney film that comes close to being this spectacular. Still to this day, a lot about how this came to be is a mystery, and that's what makes such a timeless masterpiece.
